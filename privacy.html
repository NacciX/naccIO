    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Nacci Program Policies play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for everyone using Nacci. 
    Be sure to check back from time to time, as these policies may change. Please also refer to Nacci’s Terms of Service
    for more information. Spam and Bulk Mail Don’t use Nacci to distribute spam or unsolicited commercial mail. 
    You are not allowed to use Nacci to send email in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act or other anti-spam laws; to send 
    unauthorized email via open, third-party servers; or to distribute the email addresses of any person without their consent. 
    You are not allowed to automate the Nacci interface, whether to send, delete, or filter emails, in a manner that misleads or 
    deceives users. Please keep in mind that your definition of “unsolicited” or “unwanted” mail may differ from your email 
    recipients’ perception. Exercise judgment when sending email to a large number of recipients, even if the recipients elected 
    to receive emails from you in the past. When Nacci users mark emails as spam, it increases the likelihood that future messages 
    you send will also be classified as spam by our anti-abuse systems. The Creation and Use of Multiple Nacci Accounts Don’t create 
    or use multiple accounts to abuse Nacci policies, bypass Nacci account limitations, circumvent filters, or otherwise subvert 
    restrictions placed on your account.(For example, if you’ve been blocked by another user or have had your Nacci account disabled 
    due to abuse, don’t create a replacement account that engages in similar activity.)
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>You’re also not allowed to create Nacci accounts 
    by automated means or buy, sell, trade, or re-sell Nacci accounts to others. Malware Don’t use Nacci to transmit 
    viruses, malware, worms, defects, Trojan horses, corrupted files, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature. 
    In addition, don’t distribute content that harms or interferes with the operation of networks, servers, or other infrastructure 
    belonging to Nacci or others. Fraud, Phishing, and other Deceptive Practices You may not access another user’s Nacci account 
    without their explicit permission. Don’t use Nacci to trick, mislead, or deceive other users into sharing information under false 
    pretenses. Don’t phish for users’ data such as login information, passwords, financial details, or government identification numbers, 
    or use Nacci as part of a scheme to defraud others. Child Safety Nacci has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery. 
    If we become aware of such content, we will report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as required by law.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>We may also take disciplinary action, including termination, against the Nacci accounts of those involved. Nacci prohibits the grooming 
    of children using Nacci, defined as a set of actions aimed at establishing a connection with a child to lower the child's inhibitions 
    in preparation for sexual abuse, trafficking, or other exploitation. If you believe a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, 
    exploitation, or been trafficked, contact your local law enforcement immediately. If you have already made a report to law enforcement and 
    still need help, or you have concerns a child is being or was subjected to grooming using Nacci, you can report the behavior to Nacci 
    using this form. Please remember that you can always block any person you do not want to be contacted by on Nacci. Copyright Respect 
    copyright laws. Don’t infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, including patent, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary 
    rights. You are also not allowed to encourage or induce others to violate intellectual property rights. You can report copyright infringement 
    to Nacci by using this form. Harassment Don’t use Nacci to harass, intimidate or threaten others. Anyone found to be using Nacci for these 
    purposes may have their account disabled. Illegal Activity Keep it legal. Don’t use Nacci to promote, organize, or engage in unlawful activities.
